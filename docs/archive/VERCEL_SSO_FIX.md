# üîê Fixing Vercel SSO 401 Error

## Problem
The production deployment returns a 401 error with `_vercel_sso_nonce` cookie, indicating Vercel SSO/Team authentication is blocking public access to your app.

## Solution

### Option 1: Disable SSO via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Login to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Sign in to your account

2. **Navigate to Project Settings**
   - Select your project: `accelerate-content-automation`
   - Click on "Settings" tab

3. **Disable Authentication**
   - Go to "Security" or "Authentication" section
   - Look for "Password Protection" or "Vercel Authentication"
   - Toggle it OFF or set to "None"
   - Save changes

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - The change should apply immediately
   - Test URL: https://accelerate-content-automation.vercel.app
   - Should now load without 401 error

### Option 2: Deploy to Personal Account

If the project is under a team account with enforced SSO:

1. **Create Personal Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Remove existing Vercel link
   rm -rf .vercel
   
   # Login to personal account
   vercel login
   
   # Deploy to personal account
   vercel --prod
   ```

2. **Select Personal Account**
   - When prompted, choose your personal account (not team)
   - This avoids team-level SSO restrictions

### Option 3: Configure Public Access in vercel.json

Already implemented in your `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "public": true
}
```

However, this may be overridden by team-level settings.

## Current Deployment Status

- **Latest Deployment**: https://accelerate-content-automation-jgnhukrx3.vercel.app
- **Issue**: Returns 401 with SSO cookie
- **Root Cause**: Team-level authentication enabled
- **Fix Required**: Disable in Vercel Dashboard

## Testing After Fix

1. **Check Public Access**
   ```bash
   curl -I https://accelerate-content-automation.vercel.app
   # Should return 200 OK, not 401
   ```

2. **Test Login Page**
   - Visit: https://accelerate-content-automation.vercel.app/login
   - Should display login form

3. **Test Authentication Flow**
   - Login with: `admin@test.com` / `Admin123!`
   - Should redirect to dashboard

## Local Development (Working)

The app works correctly locally:
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Access at
http://localhost:3001

# Test credentials
Email: admin@test.com
Password: Admin123!
```

## Additional Notes

- The 401 error is NOT from your app's authentication
- It's Vercel's platform-level authentication
- The `_vercel_sso_nonce` cookie confirms this
- Your app code and configuration are correct
- Only the Vercel dashboard setting needs adjustment

## Support

If you cannot access Vercel dashboard settings:
1. Contact your Vercel team admin
2. Request removal of SSO for this project
3. Or request deployment to personal account

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Check current deployment
vercel ls

# Get project info
vercel project ls

# Check team settings (if admin)
vercel team ls
```

## Summary

‚úÖ **App code**: Fixed and working
‚úÖ **Local testing**: Fully functional
‚úÖ **Vercel config**: Correctly configured
‚ùå **Vercel SSO**: Needs to be disabled in dashboard

The only remaining step is to disable SSO in the Vercel dashboard.
